# CRYSTALProjectTools

Once the repository has been cloned, please run the setup bash script in order to link the main executable python files to your path directory. Do this by locating the cloned directory and running the following commands:

  `bash `
  
  `source ~/.bashrc`

By default, executing the [band.py](band.py) or [doss.py](doss.py) files is done through `band` and `doss` respectively. However the set up script offers the user the optionality of setting their own alias.

In order to run the `band` or `doss` executables one can run the following commands:

  `band /path/to/band.f25`
  
  `doss /path/to/doss.f25`

Alternatively, you can work out of the directory with the .f25 files, in which case only the filename is required.
