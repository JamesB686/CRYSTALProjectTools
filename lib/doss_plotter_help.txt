When calling the doss plotting function, the command line instructtion can be used:

    doss /path/to/file/filename.f25

Alternatively one can simply call the doss function and the program will prompt the file to be entered in.

The program is semi-specific to a particular class of metal complex and therefore should be used appropriately.

The following arguments are available for the doss plotting system with their respective default values:

    - beta (True)                   :  Required if the DOSS has been plotted in an unrestricted formalism.
    - fermi (True)                  :  Generates a fermi line on the plot.
    - save (False)                  :  Saves a copy of the output plot as a png file.
    - units ('eV')                  :  Sets the units of the plot (choice of eV or Ha).
    - title (None)                  :  Generates a title for the plot.
    - plot_label (False)            :  Boolean for generating labels for the overlayed plots.
    - labels (None)                 :  List of labels for the plot.

The following values are modifiable, however often only the defaults are necessary. 
Therefore there is an option to use the default values for the following arguments:

    - beta
    - fermi
    - save
    - units
    - title

The labelling will be checked via a single user input, which if returned true will open up the labelling optionality.
