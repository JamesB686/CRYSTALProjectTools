When calling the band plotting function, the command line instructtion can be used:

    band /path/to/file/filename.f25

Alternatively one can simply call the band function and the program will prompt the file to be entered in.

The program is semi-specific to a particular class of metal complex and therefore should be used appropriately.

The following arguments are available for the band plotting system with their respective default values:

    - beta (True)                   :  Required if the band has been plotted in an unrestricted formalism.
    - band_num (None)               :  A list of two numbers that specfiy a range of bands to be plotted.
    - relabel (None)                :  Single number that specifies the mimimum band if that is not the first band evaluated.
    - fermi (True)                  :  Generates a fermi line on the plot.
    - fermi_label (False)           :  Generates the fermi label in the legend.
    - save (False)                  :  Saves a copy of the output plot as a png file.
    - units ('eV')                  :  Sets the units of the plot (choice of eV or Ha).
    - title (None)                  :  Generates a title for the plot.
    - alpha_band_highlight (None)   :  A list containing the set of alpha bands that wish to be highlighted in the plot.
    - beta_band_highlight (None)    :  A list containing the set of beta bands that wish to be highlighted in the plot.
    - highlight_relabel (False)     :  Boolean for relabelling the highlighted bands so that they are commensurate with the band labels.
    - lower_band (None)             :  Number specifying the lower band to change.

The following values are modifiable, however often only the defaults are necessary. 
Therefore there is an option to use the default values for the following arguments:

    - beta
    - band_num
    - relabel
    - fermi
    - fermi_label
    - save
    - units
    - title

The highlighting will be checked via a single user input, which if returned true will open up the highlighting optionality.
